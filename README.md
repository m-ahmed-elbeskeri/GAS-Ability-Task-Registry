GAS Ability Task Registry (Plugin)
Welcome to the GAS Ability Task Registry – a community-driven Unreal Engine plugin designed to collect, organize, and share Gameplay Ability System (GAS) ability tasks. This is an open-source initiative to help Unreal developers avoid duplicating effort by creating a centralized, growing library of useful UGameplayTask-derived functionality.

🚀 What is this?
While working with GAS, I realized I was re-creating the same ability tasks across multiple projects. So I thought:

“Why not start collecting and sharing them in one place?”

This repo is the result. It has now been packaged into a plugin and will eventually be released on the Unreal Marketplace (for free, of course) for everyone to use, contribute to, and benefit from.

📦 Plugin Structure
This project is structured as a standard Unreal plugin.

All tasks are created as modular UGameplayTask-based nodes intended for use in GAS-based Ability blueprints or C++ logic.

Current tasks are organized under:

/Source/GASAbilityTaskRegistry/

🧩 Why This Exists
✅ Avoid duplicated effort – so many developers are creating the same tasks independently.

✅ Encourage sharing – if you've made something useful, push it in!

✅ Clean packaging – I’ll clean up and organize everything before packaging.

✅ Open collaboration – anyone is welcome to contribute, improve, or review.

🙌 Contributing
Feel free to:

Submit your own custom ability tasks via PR

Fork and build from this plugin

Report bugs, suggest improvements, or document use cases

I'll regularly clean and refactor the contributions for final packaging in the Marketplace version.
