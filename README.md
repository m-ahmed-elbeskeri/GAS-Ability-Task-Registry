Welcome to the **GAS Ability Task Registry** ‚Äì a free, open-source Unreal Engine plugin containing a growing collection of `UGameplayTask`-based ability tasks for use with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

This project is community-driven and open to contributions. The goal is to avoid duplicated effort by creating a centralized library of useful GAS tasks. Eventually, this will be released on the Unreal Marketplace (100% free).

## üìÜ What Is This?

Unreal GAS developers often find themselves recreating the same `AbilityTasks` across different projects. This plugin aims to:

- üìö Collect commonly used or useful custom `AbilityTasks`
- üîÅ Reduce redundancy across GAS-based projects
- üî® Provide a structured, plugin-ready format for easy integration
- ü§ù Allow the community to share and contribute tasks

---

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repo into your project's `Plugins` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-ahmed-elbeskeri/GAS-Ability-Task-Registry.git
   ```
2. Regenerate project files.
3. Build and enable the plugin from the Unreal Editor.
